** This is a sample to demostrate ASP.NET Web API observability using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry. 

*This is to demostrate the usage of .NET Core 3.1 with OpenTelemetry. However, it is not officially supported as .NET 3.0 has been deprecated since 2020 and .NET 3.1 since 2022 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) and might possess security risk too.

*It is highly recommended to upgrade your .NET to supported LTS version.
